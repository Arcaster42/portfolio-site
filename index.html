            <h2>Background</h2>
            <br>
            <p id="bg">I received my first computer in 1993 at the age of five. My first experience involved
                launching a shareware copy of Doom by accessing the command prompt. 
                Since 2000, I have been programming as a hobby starting with Visual Basic, mostly playing
                with WinForms and fumbling my way through some concepts such as classes and methods. Eventually
                I got heavily into gaming and, over time, became very familiar with PC hardware. Throughout gaming,
                I developed programming fundamentals using in-game editors, modding, and development engines.</p>
            <p id="bg">At 19 I established myself in the workforce as management in a national electronics retail
                company where I developed a greater knowledge of hardware. It was during this time that I began
                teaching myself German, studying daily. Over the next several years, I vacationed to Germany several
                times while working and moving into a commercial construction management position.
            </p>
            <p id="bg">
                I decided I wanted to run my own company and obtain a college degree, so at 23, I enrolled in Kennesaw
                State University and incorporated Eonian Enterprises, LLC. This company served as a management and IT
                consulting company that gave me opportunities to work with several small companies, evolving into a
                small business development firm over time. During this time, I used contacts in Germany to secure an
                internship at Thyssen Schachtbau, an international mining and engineering firm. Having felt the need
                to make up for lost time, I overloaded my semesters and graduated in only three years.
            </p>
            <p id="bg">
                After graduating, I received an offer to work in Hiroshima, Japan. Having been eager to be abroad, I
                accepted the position and was moved within two weeks. Arriving without knowing any Japanese, I began
                self-studying until I became conversational. It was during this time that I had the greatest development
                in my programming skills in C# and R while developing a strong interest in statistics and data science.
            </p>
            <p id="bg">
                Now at 30, I am seeking an opportunity to settle into a permanent, fulfilling career that allows me to
                use my current and developing skillsets while continuing to improve my expertise and add new abilities.
                Having such a broad range of experiences, I have become incredibly well-rounded, but my ultimate goal now
                is to achieve a great level of depth, and I intend to do so by using my greatest ability: desire and capacity
                to learn.
